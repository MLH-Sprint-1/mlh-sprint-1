Collable is an initiative to improve education systems and support not just Students but also Professors. 
There are hundreds of valuable education apps which are mostly student centric. The educational apps generally do not constitute to the school grading system. If a student is brilliant and performs well in the assignments online other than school, they aren't able to improve their academic grades with that. 

There are amazing platforms like Stack Overflow which allows anyone to ask unlimited questions. The inquirer gets the benefit as thier questions get answered but the answerer doesn't recieve anything except some ranking or points. 


> What if those points could be used to improve your academic grades?

We present Collable to help your peers and get credits in return. Share your knowledge, be a rockstar and get excellent grades.

It's a win win! :blush:

## We started here :point_down: 

Collable is the product developed as a part of MLH Explorer fellowship Sprint-1. It is strictly dveveloped keeping theme 'Education' and focus 'Git' in my mind.

## Technologies Used :computer: 

To backup the super powerful backend we used node.js. The simple yet eye catchy frontend is based on React and CSS.
The prompt ML algorithm is prepared using Python. 
We take privacy strictly and save your data securely on Firebase. 

## Future Scope :bulb: 

Education is really important and we truly believe in its power. The more we contribute towards it the better will be our future.
We want to make our past and future generations proud :dizzy:.


Collable doesn't stop here, we will keep continue working on that. We hope to bring multiple features in near future but some of them are:

* :sunny: Personal visualization and graphs showing your progress over time
* :sunny: Detailed report telling which topics/subjects want your focus
* :sunny: 1:1 calls among peers
* :sunny: Resource hub for serving free resources
