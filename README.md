# Collable

Collable is an initiative to improve education systems and support not just Students but also Professors. 
There are hundreds of valuable education apps which are mostly student centric. The educational apps generally do not constitute to the school grading system. If a student is brilliant and performs well in the assignments online other than school, they aren't able to improve their academic grades with that. We also have amazing platform like Stack Overflow which allows anyone to ask unlimited questions. The inquirer gets the benefit as thier questions get answered but the answerer doesn't recieve anything except some ranking or points. 

What if those pomts could be used to improve your academic grades?

We have developed Collable for exactly that purpose. The person who answers any question gets credit which is further used to improve their grades. 

To summarize:

## Problems with current educational apps and platforms:

* Mostly student centric
* Does not help to improve acadmic grades
* Answerer doesn't get enough benefits inturn of their time and answers

## How Collable helps?

* Helps both students and professors
* Answer questions and get credits in return
* Improve your academic grades and excel both acaedemically and online

Among many super beneficial features, here are some of them:

## What's in for Professors?

We claimed how Collable is different, let's tell you how

* Professors know what topics are most unclear to students
* Edit your content accordingly
* In virtual world, when there are 0.1% offline interactions, know who's the star of your class

## Motivation behind Collable:

Collable is the product developed as a part of MLH Explorer fellowship Sprint-1. It is strictly dveveloped keeping theme 'Education' and focus 'Git' in my mind.

## Technologies Used:

To backup the super powerful backend we used node.js. The simple yet eye catchy frontent is based on React, CSS and ______. We take privacy strictly and save your data securely on Firebase. 

## Future Scope: 

Education is really important and we truly believe in its power. The more we contribute towards it the better will be our future. Collable doesn't stonp here, we will keep continue working on that. We hope we'll bring multiple features in near future but some of them are:

* Personal visualization and graphs showing your progress over time

* 1:1 calls among peers
* Resoyce hub for serving free resources
